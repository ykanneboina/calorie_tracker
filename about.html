         This way, students can be more aware about how much calories they are eating and how healthy the food that they they buy is.
         One of the key features of this website is that it gives the recommended amount of calorie intake for a person depending on their age,
         gender, and activity level. Another feature is that it adds up the calories that you ate in total and gives the percentage of the 
         recommended calories that you ate. It also gives the total amount of calories that you ate. Our goal is to make this website accessible 
         to everyone who eats food from Dublin High School so that we can become a more healthier and aware community.
